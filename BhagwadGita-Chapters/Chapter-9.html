<br/>
4. The whole cosmic manifestation is pervaded by Me by My unmanifested form. All beings exist in Me though I am not in them.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
29. I am equally situated in all beings. There is none who is particularly hateful to me or dearer to Me. But those who worship Me with devotion I am in them and they are in Me.<br/>
<br/>
30. Even if a man of sinful conduct worships Me with undisturbed devotion, he should be regarded as a saintly person because he is has made the right resolve.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
34. Constantly think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me only and offer your respects to Me. By constantly repeating My name in your heart and established in Me, you will definitely come to Me.<br/>
<br/>
